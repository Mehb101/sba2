This is a simple, responsive website for a fictional company called Accessible Design Co. It features a header with a logo and navigation bar, a hero section with a background image and call-to-action button, an About section describing the company, a Services section with a grid layout of offerings, a Contact form with accessible labels, and a footer with social links. The site is built using semantic HTML and CSS with Flexbox and Grid, and it follows accessibility best practices for keyboard navigation, focus states, and meaningful alt text for images.  

To view the site, simply open the `last.html` file in a web browser with the `last.css` file in the same folder. 

1. Accessibility challenges and solutions:
The main challenge was making sure all interactive elements, like links and forms, were keyboard-accessible and screen-reader friendly. I addressed this by using proper HTML labels, aria attributes where needed, meaningful alt text for images.

2. Ensuring responsive and accessible design:
I used CSS Flexbox for the navigation and CSS Grid for the main content so the layout adjusts on different screen sizes. I also tested the site on mobile, tablet, and desktop views to make sure everything is readable and usable.

3. Helpful tools and resources:
I found the WebAIM Contrast Checker, MDN Web Docs for HTML/CSS guidance, and the W3C ARIA documentation most helpful in making the site accessible and responsive.
